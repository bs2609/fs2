 * A general purpose file-operation (or any operation who's progress and completion can be measured by a single number) progress tracker.

 * 
 * the defaults (sample lifetime and sample-clumping interval) are only sensible for file transfers order of 1000mbits/sec.
 * For slower transfers (such as people filling a hall) reduce the parameters accordingly.
 * 
 * Samples are clumped together and recorded only every 100ms by default at most.
 * Samples are only kept for 10 seconds at most, implying a maximum of 100 samples.
 * 
 * Trackers may also be formed into a hierarchy with progress propagated to a tracker's parent.
